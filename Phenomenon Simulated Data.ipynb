    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:  \n",
    "• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.  \n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.  \n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.  \n",
    "• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set."

    "As a lecturer I might pick the real-world phenomenon of the performance of students studying a ten-credit module. After some research, I decide that the most interesting variable related to this is the mark a student receives in the module - this is going to be one of my variables (grade).  \n",
    "Upon investigation of the problem, I find that the number of hours on average a student studies per week (hours), the number of times they log onto Moodle in the first three weeks of term (logins), and their previous level of degree qualification (qual) are closely related to grade. The hours and grade variables will be non-negative real number with two decimal places, logins will be a non-zero integer and qual will be a categorical variable with four possible values: \n",
    "- none\n",
    "- bachelors\n",
    "- masters, or\n",
    "- phd  \n",
    "\n",
    "After some online research, I find that full-time post-graduate students study on average four hours per week with a standard deviation of a quarter of an hour and that a normal distribution is an acceptable model of such a variable. Likewise, I investigate the other four variables, and I also look at the relationships between the variables. I devise an algorithm (or method) to generate such a data set, simulating values of the four variables for two-hundred students. I detail all this work in my notebook, and then I add some code in to generate a data set with those properties. "

    "As part of the ressearch into this exercise, I thoughtn it best that we started off with an exisitng data set that was relevant to the information that i wanted to simulate, in order to provide some structure, guidance as well as some fallback information on the topic. \n",
    "The area that I wanted to cover is in relation to health. Obviously, one of the unavoidable aspects to life in 2020 hasm been COVID-19, as everyone is painfully aware. \n",
    "HOweverm, one of the aspects that appears to be examined is that of the relationshipn between hte NPHET committee and hte Government of Ireland. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the outset, there was a direct line of communication between the two boides, but as time went on, and the perview of the governments view fo teh world expeanded, there were layers of control put in place to provide distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just public health, there were another numbers of factors to be catered for, such as The economy, mental health etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we take the view of what the remit ofthe delivery of NPHET is for, in the strictest sense of the world, they are responsible for the public health. In Ireland public health has been a contenitious topic over decades. \n",
    "There has been a continuous rise in the amount of money required to work the system, with a lot of high profile costs being reported on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we review the concept of advise and what becomes the recommended advise and or lae fro teh point of view of the governemnt, we are left to believe that there is no way we can have both. that we can't have a full lockdown, duw to the cpacity of hospitals as well as levels of training of ICU staff and nurses to cater for the re-assigned workload that OCVID has caused. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ireladn has suffered from a fundamental issue of how to manage it's health system for a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On a societal level, there are a number of changes that can be reviewed to reduce the level of activity that is burdened our system. One of the simple steps to ne taken, is to potentially review the general health of hte nation. \n",
