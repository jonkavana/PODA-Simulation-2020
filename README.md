# PODA-Simulation-2020
GMIT Coursework

The purpose of this file is to help in the instruction for creating simulated data relating to a real world phenomenen. In order to correctly complete this task, there are a number of steps that need to be completed prior to the simulation stage of the project.
There are pieces of information that can be utilised to aid the project. One of these aids will be a dataset that relates to the area under review. This will allow for a number of the key areas to be reviewed, such as headings, units in which the criteria are recorded in, as well as an overall frmaework for the dataset.

#### Overview of the Problem Statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

    - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
    - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
    - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
    - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.


#### Work Breakdown Structure of Project

Establish a repository and clone this into the local folder - Completed  
- Test the repository to ensure that it is syncing correctly
- Send the repository once it is in working order to the URL requested. 

Review all material that relates to simulation on the Programming for Data Analytics Home Page  - Completed

Review all material that was completed in the first project of the year - centered around the Numpy.Random Package - Completed  
- Need to see what material is part of the overall package
- Where relevant, the information of the package and it's relevance to simulating data need to be exaplined. 
- Full review of the distributions and how it can be leveraged for use in a data set. 

Review of phenomenon and its wider application  
- Read across some data sets and find an area where the structure of the data set is transparent and laid out clearly. 
- Where there is a data set that can be used and is relevant to the simulated data set, use this as a point of comparision/contrast.
- Develpoing on from the information taken from the data set, is there any peer reviewed information or giudance that can be used in order to help create accurately simulated data. 

DataSet to be simulated  
- Introduction in place to ensure the rationale for the decision making process is clear as well as the intended outcome of the trial
- Decide on the characteristics that are going to become part of the new dataset
- Within these sets, can there be a spread of sources for the numbers being generated. 
- Link the information that is being created with real world informaiton
- Robust conclusion added at the end of the trial to ensure that the explanation for the relationship is clear.
