# PODA-Simulation-2020
GMIT Coursework

The purpose of this file is to ascertain simulated data relating to a real world phenomenen

#### Overview of the Problem Statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

    - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
    - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
    - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
    - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.


#### Work Breakdown Structure of Project

Establish a repository and clone this into the local folder
- Test the repository to ensure that it is syncing correctly
- Send the repository once it is in working order to the URL requested. 

Review all material that relates to simulation on the Programming for Data Analytics Page

Review all material that was completed in the first project of the year - centered around the Numpy.Random Package
- Need to see what material that relates to the package and it's relevance to simulating data. 
- Full review of the distributions and how it can be leveraged for use in a data set. 

Review of phenomenon and it'swider application
- Read across some data sets and find an area where the structure of the data set is transparent and laid out clearly. 
- Where there is a data set that can be used and is relevant to the simulated data set, use this as a point of comparision/contrast.
